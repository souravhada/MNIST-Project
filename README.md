# MNIST Project

## Description
This project utilizes TensorFlow and the MNIST dataset to train a neural network model for handwritten digit classification. It consists of several Jupyter notebook cells performing various tasks such as data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.

## Results and Conclusion
The trained model achieved a test accuracy of 98.00% with a test loss of 0.07%.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook `MNIST_Project.ipynb`.
2. Execute each cell sequentially to run the code.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to understand the project flow and results.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
